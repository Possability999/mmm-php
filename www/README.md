# With Docker and Docker Compose set up, you can start your development environment by running:


docker-compose up

This command builds (if necessary) and starts the container. Your application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

#If you encounter issues, you can debug by accessing the Docker container's shell:
docker-compose exec web bash
